Big thanks to Nikola who made this project with me.\
Nikola Vuković studies information engineering at the Faculty of Mathematics. Thanks to his great love for design and visual arts, as well as his significant experience in software developing and mathematics, Nikola was able to lend Vukašin a helping hand and facilitate the fruition of his idea of creative chaos.
