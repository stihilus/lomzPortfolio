I uses old slide projector to create visual effects for live band performances.

the retro fusion vj projector—a captivating blend of vintage aesthetics and modern innovation. i’ve ingeniously repurposed an old slide projector, infusing it with new life and functionality for live band performances. by enabling the use of film rolls and printing my artwork on transparent foils, this projector transforms each live show into a mesmerizing visual journey. every tweak and enhancement serves a singular purpose: to elevate the band experience, creating a unique synergy between music and visuals. join me in this artistic fusion where technology meets nostalgia, and witness the magic as the retro fusion vj projector adds an extra layer of depth and vibrancy to the stage.
