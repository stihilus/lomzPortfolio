# Ash

The concept was born in 2018 and I made this jacket and called it Agora.

The Athenians would gather in the Agora to watch the Agon, a competition among the finest. The effort accompanied by pain, paid in blood and fueled by the desire to prove oneself, the people called Agony. Some participated in the agony, while others watched with excitement. Only One paid no attention to it - he knew their Agony was insignificant compared to what lay within him. He knew that the only worthy opponent was himself. He was always the winner in the Agora.
