# Kotrljko

Kotrljko is a drawing xy machine that i created a few years ago with the help of my father. it was one of my first attempts at hardware projects and it was a challenging journey. however, in the end, kotrljko successfully creates drawings. from a technical perspective, kotrljko uses two nema17 motors, arduino shields with controllers, and wooden and metal parts that were handmade by my partner. on the software side, i utilized the universal gcode sender and Inkspace program with an addon.
