##unique digital artwork on the ethereum blockchain

cryptographics is a digital artwork hub and digital print generation tool powered by ethereum and IPFS. It allows artists, creators and collectors to come together in order to sell assets, create cryptographics and trade them, respectively. moreover, cryptographic as a form is a unique fusion of cryptography, digital art and web 3.0, greatly inspired by the dada avant-garde movement.

the cryptographics project emerged from our love for digital art, passion for building innovative decentralized apps on ethereum, and a special fondness for cryptography. we see it as an exploration of the ever growing crypto-collectibles concept, although someone pointed out to us that it can also be considered a prototype of IP management on the blockchain. but we wouldn't go as far.
