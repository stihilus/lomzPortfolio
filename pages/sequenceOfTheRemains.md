mathematical chaos can be explored in a very creative way. pick a random number between 0 and 1, and the installation, using the iterative nonlinear dynamic function popularly referred to as the “logistic map”, will produce a specific result – the onset of chaos. this result will become a “seed” in the algorithm which will visualize the result and also use it to create music from it. If we change the logistic map parameters, the music will change, carrying the tune through predictable and unpredictable patterns, making a sound that carries us through the mathematics of order and mathematics of chaos, thus giving us a chance to open the door to a new and curious branch of mathematics.
